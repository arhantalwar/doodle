Doodle is a hobby project about math art which mostly draws ![Lissajous figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve), I might write a ![blog](https://leo-high-valley.vercel.app/) on this soon.

(MADE USING DOODLE)
```c
theta = (radius) * (cosf(i/2));
theta2 = (radius2) * (cosf(i/4));
theta3 = (radius3) * (cosf(i/8));
```

## QUICK START

Dependencies

### BOOTSTRAP BUILD

You will need to bootstrap the build system for once.

```console
$ gcc nob.c -o nob
